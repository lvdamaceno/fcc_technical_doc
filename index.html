          As a popular open source development project, Python has an active
          supporting community of contributors and users that also make their
          software available for other Python developers to use under open
          source license terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows Python users to share and collaborate effectively,
          benefiting from the solutions others have already created to common
          (and sometimes even rare!) problems, as well as potentially
          contributing their own solutions to the common pool.

              <span>pip</span> is the preferred installer program. Starting with
              Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary
              installers.
            </li>

              A <i>virtual environment</i> is a semi-isolated Python environment
              that allows packages to be installed for use by a particular
              application, rather than being installed system wide.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>venv</span> is the standard tool for creating virtual
              environments, and has been part of Python since Python 3.3.
              Starting with Python 3.4, it defaults to installing
              <span>pip</span> into all created virtual environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>virtualenv</span> is a third party alternative (and
              predecessor) to <span>venv</span>. It allows virtual environments
              to be used on versions of Python prior to 3.4, which either don’t
              provide <span>venv</span> at all, or aren’t able to automatically
              install <span>pip</span>
              into created environments.

            The standard packaging tools are all designed to be used from the
            command line.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following command will install the latest version of a module
            and its dependencies from the Python Packaging Index:
          </p>
          <p id="green-highlight-box">python -m pip install SomePackage</p>
          <p id="gray-highlight-box">
            <strong>Note:</strong> For POSIX users (including Mac OS X and Linux
            users), the examples in this guide assume the use of a
            <a href="#">virtual environment</a>. <br /><br />
            For Windows users, the examples in this guide assume that the option
            to adjust the system PATH environment variable was selected when
            installing Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s also possible to specify an exact or minimum version directly
            on the command line. When using comparator operators such as
            <span>></span>, <span><</span> or some other special character which
            get interpreted by shell, the package name and the version should be
            enclosed within double quotes:
          </p>
          <p id="green-highlight-box">
            python -m pip install SomePackage==1.0.4 # specific version <br />
            python -m pip install "SomePackage>=1.0.4" # minimum version
          </p>
          <p>
            More information and resources regarding pip and its capabilities
            can be found in the <a href="#">Python Packaging User Guide</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creation of virtual environments is done through the
            <a href="#">venv</a> module. Installing packages into an active
            virtual environment uses the commands shown above.

            Python only started bundling <span>pip</span> with Python 3.4. For

            <span>pip</span> directly. At this point in time, it will often be

          <h2>Common installation issue</h2>
          <h3>Installing into the system Python on Linux</h3>
          <p>
            On Linux systems, a Python installation will typically be included
            as part of the distribution. Installing into this Python
            installation requires root access to the system, and may interfere
            with the operation of the system package manager and other
            components of the system if a component is unexpectedly upgraded
            using <span>pip</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            On such systems, it is often better to use a virtual environment or
            a per-user installation when installing packages with
            <span>pip</span>.
          </p>
          <h3>Pip not installed</h3>
          <p>
            It is possible that <span>pip</span> does not get installed by
            default. One potential fix is:
          </p>
          <p id="green-highlight-box">python -m ensurepip --default-pip</p>
          <p>
            There are also additional resources for
            <a href="#">installing pip</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Installing binary extensions</h3>
          <p>
            Python has typically relied heavily on source based distribution,
            with end users being expected to compile extension modules from
            source as part of the installation process.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the introduction of support for the binary
            <span>wheel</span> format, and the ability to publish wheels for at
            least Windows and Mac OS X through the Python Packaging Index, this
            problem is expected to diminish over time, as users are more
            regularly able to install pre-built extensions rather than needing
            to build them themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the solutions for installing
            <a href="#">scientific software</a> that are not yet available as
            pre-built <span>wheel</span> files may also help with obtaining
            other binary extensions without needing to build them locally.
