          As a popular open source development project, Python has an active
          supporting community of contributors and users that also make their
          software available for other Python developers to use under open
          source license terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          This allows Python users to share and collaborate effectively,
          benefiting from the solutions others have already created to common
          (and sometimes even rare!) problems, as well as potentially
          contributing their own solutions to the common pool.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide covers the installation part of the process. For a guide to
          creating and sharing your own Python projects, refer to the
          <a href="#">distribution guide.</a>

          <strong>Note:</strong> For corporate and other institutional users, be
          aware that many organisations have their own policies around using and
          contributing to open source software. Please take such policies into
          account when making use of the distribution and installation tools
          provided with Python.

            <li>
              <span>pip</span> is the preferred installer program. Starting with
              Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary
              installers.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <i>virtual environment</i> is a semi-isolated Python environment
              that allows packages to be installed for use by a particular
              application, rather than being installed system wide.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>venv</span> is the standard tool for creating virtual
              environments, and has been part of Python since Python 3.3.
              Starting with Python 3.4, it defaults to installing
              <span>pip</span> into all created virtual environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>virtualenv</span> is a third party alternative (and
              predecessor) to <span>venv</span>. It allows virtual environments
              to be used on versions of Python prior to 3.4, which either don’t
              provide <span>venv</span> at all, or aren’t able to automatically
              install <span>pip</span>
              into created environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <a href="#">Python Packaging Index</a> is a public repository
              of open source licensed packages made available for use by other
              Python users.
            </li>
            <li>
              The <a href="#">Python Packaging Authority</a> is the group of
              developers and documentation authors responsible for the
              maintenance and evolution of the standard packaging tools and the
              associated metadata and file format standards. They maintain a
              variety of tools, documentation, and issue trackers on both
              <a href="github.com">GitHub</a> and
              <a href="bitbucket.com">Bitbucket</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>distutils</span> is the original build and distribution
              system first added to the Python standard library in 1998. While
              direct use of <span>distutils</span> is being phased out, it still
              laid the foundation for the current packaging and distribution
              infrastructure, and it not only remains part of the standard
              library, but its name lives on in other ways (such as the name of
              the mailing list used to coordinate Python packaging standards
              development).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <i>Changed in version 3.5:</i> The use of venv is now recommended
            for creating virtual environments.
